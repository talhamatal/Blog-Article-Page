            <h2>Growing Popularity of EVs</h2>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer the future—they are the present. 
            In 2025, global EV sales reached record highs as governments, manufacturers, 
            and consumers worked together to reduce carbon emissions and adopt cleaner transportation.</p>

            <h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
            <p>Many countries are offering incentives such as tax rebates, zero-emission credits, 
          and grants for EV infrastructure. In the United States, the <abbr title="Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</abbr> 
          introduced new standards that further encourage electric adoption.</p>
            <blockquote>“The shift to electric mobility is one of the most impactful technological changes of this decade.”

            <h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
            <p>Despite rapid progress, the EV industry still faces challenges such as limited 
          charging infrastructure in rural areas and the environmental impact of battery production. 
          Manufacturers are investing heavily in recycling programs and sustainable battery technologies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expanding fast-charging networks</li>
                <li>Reducing production costs</li>
                <li>Improving battery lifespan</li>
            </ul>
